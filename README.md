# Microservice Template

This repository is a template for building Python microservices using FastAPI. It provides a ready-to-use structure with a testing suite and a CI pipeline for automated testing, linting, and Docker image publishing.

## Features
- **FastAPI**: Modern, fast web framework for building APIs.
- **Testing Suite**: Includes sample tests and setup for pytest.
- **Continuous Integration**: GitHub Actions workflow for testing, linting, and building Docker images on push.
- **Docker Support**: Dockerfile and docker-compose setup for local development and CI.

## Usage
1. **Clone this repository** and use it as a starting point for your microservice.
2. **Develop your API** in the `src/` directory.
3. **Write tests** in the `tests/` directory.
4. **Run tests locally**:
   ```bash
   docker compose -f tests/docker-compose.yaml --project-directory tests up --build --abort-on-container-exit --exit-code-from test
   ```
5. **CI/CD**: On each push to `main`, the GitHub Actions workflow will run tests, lint your code, and (if applicable) build and push a Docker image.

## Customization
- Update the API logic in `src/server.py`.
- Adjust dependencies in `requirements.txt`.
- Change the Docker image name in the workflow by editing the `DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME` environment variable at the top of `.github/workflows/release-and-nightly.yaml`.

## OpenAPI Response Test

The test in `tests/test_openapi_responses.py` automatically checks that all API endpoints documented in the OpenAPI specification (generated by FastAPI) and expected to return a 200 response actually do so in practice. It does this by:
- Fetching the OpenAPI schema from the running service.
- Iterating over all endpoints and HTTP methods with a documented 200 response.
- Sending requests (with example payloads if needed) to each endpoint.
- Asserting that the response status code is 200.

**Intention:**
This test ensures that your API implementation matches its documentation. If an endpoint is documented to return a 200 response, but does not, the test will fail. This helps catch discrepancies between code and documentation, and ensures that clients relying on the OpenAPI spec can trust the documented behavior.

**Importance:**
- Prevents drift between API code and documentation.
- Increases confidence for API consumers and integrators.
- Encourages accurate and up-to-date OpenAPI specs as part of your CI pipeline.
